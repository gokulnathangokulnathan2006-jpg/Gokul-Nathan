# Phase 5: Project Development Phase

## Development Flow
- The user registers or logs in, opens the home page and chooses a planner (Home, Party or Jewelry).
- The user fills the form with budget and preferences; the Jewelry form also accepts an outfit image.
- Submitting the form sends a POST request to the matching FastAPI endpoint.
- The service layer builds a prompt and calls Gemini 1.5 Flash Pro, then links the result to platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, IKEA, Swiggy, Zomato and OYO.
- The response is formatted into structured recommendations and saved to the user's history.
- Results appear as card-like layouts on the recommendations page.
