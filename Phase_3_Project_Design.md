# Phase 3: Project Design Phase

## System Architecture
PocketSmart AI has three main parts: the Frontend (HTML, CSS and Jinja2 templates), the Backend (FastAPI application) and the AI layer (Google Gemini 1.5 Flash Pro). The request flow is:

```
Browser (HTML form + CSS)
 -> FastAPI endpoints (main.py)
 -> Planner logic (gemini_utils.py: prompts, budget formatting, image analysis)
 -> Gemini 1.5 Flash Pro (cloud)
 -> Recommendation cards shown on the page
```

## Model Selection
| Model | Used For | Benefits |
|---|---|---|
| Gemini 1.5 Flash Pro (via API) | Budget understanding, image analysis, structured suggestions, platform-specific product recommendations for Home, Party and Jewelry | Multimodal (text + image), fast responses, structured outputs, cloud inference |

## Module Design
| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `main.py` | FastAPI app, endpoints, CORS, session handling, startup |
| `gemini_utils.py` | Prompt orchestration, budget formatting, domain segmentation, image analysis, fallback logic |
| `routes/` | API endpoints |
| `services/` | Recommendation logic and AI calls |
| `models/` | Input and output schemas |
| `templates` / `static` | Jinja2 HTML pages and CSS styling |
| `.env` | Gemini API key and configuration |

## API Endpoint Design
| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/generate-home` | Home interior recommendations (furniture, decor, lighting) |
| `/generate-party` | Catering, venue and decoration options for events |
| `/generate-jewelry` | Text + image input to return style-matched jewelry |
| `/register`, `/login`, `/logout` | User registration, authentication and session end |
| `/token` | Issues a JWT token after successful authentication |
| `/session-info`, `/session-data` | Session metadata and session-specific data for personalization |
| `/recommendations-details` | Detailed AI recommendations by budget, preferences and category |
| `/history` | User's past recommendation queries and results |

## AI Design
- Gemini receives a structured prompt for each planner (home, party or jewelry) containing the budget, preferences and platform list.
- For the Jewelry Planner the outfit image is sent together with the text prompt for colour and style analysis.
- Prompts are tuned for budget interpretation so that the suggested items stay within the entered budget.
- Errors are handled safely, and default recommendations are returned if the AI result is insufficient.
