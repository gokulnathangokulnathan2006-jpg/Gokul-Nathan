# Phase 7: Project Documentation Phase

## Technology Stack Summary
- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Jinja2, HTML and CSS
- Google Gemini 1.5 Flash Pro API
- JWT authentication and session management

## AI Integration
PocketSmart AI uses Gemini 1.5 Flash Pro, a multimodal model, to interpret budgets, analyze outfit images, generate structured suggestions and recommend platform-specific products. All AI logic is kept in the utility file `gemini_utils.py`, which handles prompt orchestration, budget formatting, domain segmentation and image analysis, so the routes stay clean and each planner can be upgraded independently.

## Security Considerations
- The Gemini API key is created in Google Cloud / AI Studio and stored in the `.env` file, never in the code.
- User credentials are stored securely and access to protected routes uses JWT tokens.
- CORS headers and session management control frontend communication.
- Errors are handled with clear messages instead of crashing the application.

## Limitations
- Suggestions depend on AI output and should be checked before buying.
- Cloud features need an internet connection and a valid API key.
- Platform data is simulated in this version, so live prices and availability may differ.
- Currently run locally only.

## Future Enhancements
- Live product and price integration with the Amazon, Flipkart, IKEA, Swiggy, Zomato and OYO APIs.
- More planners, such as travel, wardrobe and gifting.
- Multilingual support and a mobile app.
- Wishlists, saved plans and shareable budget reports.

## Conclusion
PocketSmart AI redefines the way individuals plan budgets for everyday lifestyle needs by delivering smart, AI-driven recommendations across home interiors, party planning and jewelry selection. By combining FastAPI with Gemini 1.5 Flash Pro, the system processes budgets, preferences and even images to produce accurate, context-aware suggestions from trusted platforms. Its modular backend, secure session handling and responsive Jinja2 frontend make it efficient, scalable and user-centric, and it shows how generative AI can bring budget-friendly intelligent recommendations to everyday decisions.
