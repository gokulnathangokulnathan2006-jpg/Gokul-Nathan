# Phase 6: Project Testing Phase

## Test Approach
The application was run locally with Uvicorn and tested end to end through the browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000. Each planner was tried with varied budgets and preferences to confirm that the correct module is called, the recommendations stay within budget and the results appear on the page.

## Functional Test Cases

|---|---|---|---|

| 6 | History | Open the history page | Past queries and results are listed |
| 7 | Logout | Click logout | Session ends and the login page opens |
